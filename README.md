# TODO

-   Make buttons clickable - they should add desires to the list, first just add them randomly without any constraints
-   Add constraints to adding desires in the container - make sure if one desire is added to a container, no other container may add it. Also handle clicking the button when there are no desires left.
-   Add an option to remove a desire from a container - it should be returned to the list of available for adding desires
-   Figure out how to enforce strong typing for everything with typescript
-   Introduce Pinia, migrate desires to the store and rewrite buttons behaviour to use it
-   ...
-   ...
-   Profit!
